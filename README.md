### Hi! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer from MÃ©xico who likes dogs and programming for fun. Most of my projects are either on my machine or a selfhosted repo of some kind, but you can find some of them here. These are *mostly* old or school related projects.

#### Currently working on...
Finishing my degree in computer systems engineering, and also thinkering with electronics and IoT in my spare time.

#### Things I want to learn
- Rust (how original).
- A bit more about IoT.
- ML and data science.

#### Some of the languages I've used in my projects
