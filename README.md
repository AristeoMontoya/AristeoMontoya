## Welcome to my GitHub profile!
### A bit about me
I'm a software engineer from MÃ©xico who likes dogs and programming for fun. Most of my projects are either on my machine or a selfhosted repo of some kind, but you can find some of them here. These are *mostly* old or school related projects. Some of them are utilities that I built for myself.

My hobbies include 3D printing, programming, thinkering with electronics and photography. I also enjoy exploring FOSS and services for my selfhosted *server* (a humble raspberry pi).

#### What I'm up to
Wokring as a full time Java Developer while concluding the last process to obtain my degree.

#### Things I want to do in the near future
In the near future I want to persue a masters degree in CS and learn a bit more Python and/or Go.
