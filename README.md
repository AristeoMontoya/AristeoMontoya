## Welcome to my GitHub profile!
### A bit about me
Hello there! I'm a software engineer from MÃ©xico, passionate about technology and what some people consider to be nerdy stuff.

Most projects in this profile are university projects or projects that I developed during my spare time (while being in university).

### Some of my hobbies
My hobbies include 3D printing, programming, tinkering with electronics and photography.
I also enjoy exploring FOSS and services for my selfhosted *server* (a humble raspberry pi).

#### What I'm up to
Working as a full time Java Developer, currently focusing on spring.

#### Things I want to do in the near future
In the near future I want to pursue a masters degree in CS and learn a bit more Python and/or Go.
